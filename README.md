Official ORM of Solital framework

Katrina ORM is a component that brings the object-oriented application development paradigm closer to the relational database paradigm. It helps to carry out common routines, such as the famous CRUD (create, read, edit and delete), in addition to having a data paging system.

Katrina ORM uses the Active Record standard and query builder to manipulate the data in the database.
